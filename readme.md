##### v0.7 - post 27/08/2021 variant
- This is assume you have your python environment installed with all depdendencies from version 0.6b and eveyrthing is ready to use 
- File changes:
	- ADD gspider7.py
- Instead of imposing date range into the search url, the date is put under loop on daily basis. 
- Parameter is changed in the code from line 14 to line 18:  
```    
	# Change Parameter Here, 
    startDate =  datetime.date(2020, 7, 8)
    endDate = datetime.date(2020, 7, 15)
    region1 = "china"
    region2 = "CN"
    query = "semiconductor"
```  
- for `startDate` and `endDate`, change the value inside the bracket with the format (yyyy, m, d)
- `region1` always in **lowercase** full name (i.e. china, europe, united+states, south+korea, etc) and `region2` alwats in short forms (i.e. CN, GB, US, KR, etc)
- I suggest for `region1` and `region2` to be used in pair (e.g.: singapore & SG, china & CN, united+states & US, etc)
- `query` is as per usual, however, I suggest we stick with **semiconductor** for now. 
- What to check:
	- **Region** -> Kindly check whether any "leaking" news (i.e. news unrelated to that particular region)
	- **Excerpt** -> which source gives excerpt that does not make sense (i.e. subscription request, ads, something gibberish, etc)
- Things to take note:
	- While it is possible to check on one month range like what we did on earlier version, I suggest to gradually increase, to avoid the potential of scraping "too much" from Google and get your IP banned
	- Also take note, the current command line to run this version is simplified into: `scrapy crawl gnews7 -o <filename.csv>`
	- Previous version still run as per usual with its respective command line. 


##### v0.6b - Edward variant

- Install dependencies : `pip install newspaper3k`
- File changes:
	- ADD gspider6b.py

##### v0.6a - YM variant
- This is assume you have your python environment installed and ready to use  
- File changes:
	- ADD gspider6a.py
	- REPLACE items.py

1) Fork Edward’s Github 
2) Test the script 
3) Run the script to make sure it works 
4) Check Search engine search number corresponds with CSV download 
5) Tweak different keywords to test


	Open integrated Terminal from main googlenews folder
	Type the following:
source .env/scripts/activate

	You may encounter the following problem
 

<h1 align="center">How to Webcrawl?</h1>

## Installing and run in VSC <br>
Step 1: Download the zip file from Edward's Github.<br>

Step 2: Open VSC, open the downloaded folder.<br>

Step 3: Go to `googlenews` folder, right click and choose 'open in integrated terminal' <br>
*Note: Make sure 'googlenews' is the root directory.*<br>

Step 4: Ensure that you choose `command prompt` in Terminal. <br>
*Note: It doesn't work on Powershell, Bash etc.*<br>

Step 5: Type the following `source .env/scripts/activate` for macOS OR `cd .env/scripts` follow with `activate` on Windows.<br>

Step 6: Type `cd..`<br>

*Note: After this step, the directory WILL end with '.env' .. It should look like this: 'C:\Users\Cindy\Desktop\googlenews-scrapy-main.env'* <br>

Step 7: Type `cd..` <br>

*Note: After this step, the directory WILL NOT end with '.env' .. It should look like this: 	'C:\Users\Cindy\Desktop\googlenews-scrapy-main'* <br>

Step 8: Type `cd googlenews`. <br>

Step 9: Install scrapy by typing `pip install scrapy` <br>

*Note: If you are prompted with “pip not recognised as internal or external command” , you need to quit your VSC. Go to ‘File’ tab > ‘Close folder’ > ‘Close Window’. Relaunch VSC again > Go to Step 2 and continue.* <br>
 
Step 10: Try to run the the crawler by typing `scrapy crawl gnews`.<br>

Step 11: Create a CSV file by typing `scrapy crawl gnews3 -a query=semiconductor -a start=1/1/2020 -a end=1/31/2020 -a region=GB -o hello22.csv` where you can change the 'filename' into what you want. By running this step, web crawling begins and the web crawling results will be stored into this CSV file. <br>
