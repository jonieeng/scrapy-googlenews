For the survey team, there are a number of possible explanations for why Chinese respondents view the central government in Beijing so favorably.

Recently, remarkable progress has been made in controlling the coupled states of CQDs, but individual control of vertically stacked quantum dots is still challenging.
On the other hand, when the excitation polarization becomes parallel to the coupled direction, the polarization anisotropy of excitons, local biexcitons, and coupled biexcitons becomes enhanced with a degree of polarization of 74%.
