semiconductor,china,Intel to invest $20 billion in European chip plants,"As the jostling for global semiconductor production power intensifies, with China looking to play an increasingly influential role, Intel is spreading its wings and seeking to lay down roots in key areas of demand.
China is already globally proficient in 28nm chip technology and is absolutely determined to cash-in on 14nm semiconductors.
Hence the news that Intel is to invest US$20 billion over 10 years in constructing semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) and other supporting facilities across Europe.
If successful, in due course, the building spree will continue, and the value of Intel’s investment could rise to $100 billion in the long-term.

semiconductor,china,Chinese State Media Blasts US Plan for Digital Trade Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese state media outlets have criticized the U.S. over discussions for a digital trade agreement among Indo-Pacific economies, calling them a bid to protect American hegemony and the profits of tech companies.
Agreements signed by the U.S. “invariably serve the U.S.’ bid to defend its hegemony -- a magic word incorporating security, values and interests -- while to the signatory countries, these U.S.-dominated agreements are more like shackles restricting trade and their freedom of cooperation,” China Daily said in an editorial published online Tuesday evening.
Details of the potential agreement are still being drafted, but the pact could include countries such as Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore.
The deal could set out standards for the digital economy, including rules on the use of data, trade facilitation and electronic customs arrangements.

semiconductor,china,Chinese achieve new milestone with 56 qubit computer,"The team in China used a different technique, one that involved the use of photonic qubits—but it was also a one-trick pony.
In their demonstration, the researchers used only 56 of those qubits to tackle a well-known computer problem—sampling the output distribution of random quantum circuits.
Prior research has suggested the task set before the Chinese machine would take a conventional computer approximately eight years to complete.
It also showed that adding just two more qubits than that used by Sycamore could increase the power of a quantum computer exponentially.

This includes a number of boycotts and sanctions of products produced in the region, with solar in particular flagged alongside cotton.
Concerns around the use of forced labour in the solar supply chain have been growing, with the Foreign Affairs Committee noting that the evidence of serious human rights abuses —endorsed by the Chinese government's central leadership — is irrefutable.
A report from The Guardian in April found that 40% of UK solar panels include materials sourced from Xinjiang.

semiconductor,china,RESEARCH: Drop in global auto output causes steel scrap ...,"If you are not a subscriber but would like see a free sample report, please click hereStifled automotive output this year, driven by a supply shortage of semiconductor chips used in vehicles, has tightened prime scrap availability and widened the spreads between this grade of steelmaking raw material and obsolete scrap.While wide prime-over-obsolete spreads have been most pronounced in the United States, they are also present in European and Asian markets.
But automotive output across the globe is forecast to rise in the third quarter, which should narrow these spreads.Following Chinese authorities' attempts to cool domestic commodity prices in May, China's domestic scrap market in June was far less volatile than a month earlier.
We do not expect scrap prices to rise to levels seen in May amid the potential of further government intervention.Meanwhile, scrap has maintained its appeal in relation to other steelmaking raw materials from a price perspective, and indicators suggest that scrap consumption has been broadly increasing across China this year.
We believe this price competitiveness will continue to play a role in supporting demand.As well, China has been increasing its presence in the seaborne scrap market, which supports regional prices and reduces the premiums that the country's domestic scrap commanded relative to international levels in 2019-2020 when it halted imports.In the iron metallics segment, market participants are looking at developments in Russia after it announced an export duty on several metals, including merchant pig iron (MPI), sold outside the Eurasian Economic Union from August 1, for a period of five months.We expect that in the short term, Russian MPI exporters are likely to seek to ship volumes quickly prior to the export duty coming into effect, which could weigh on MPI prices this month.
In the medium term, the export duty should support prices, not just for products from the Commonwealth of Independent States, but globally as well.In turn, we have raised our MPI forecasts for the medium term, though we still expect softening demand from China to cast a shadow over the market and weigh on prices",2021-08-31,Metal Bulletin,https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3997679/RESEARCH-Drop-in-global-auto-output-causes-steel-scrap-price-spreads-to-widen.html

We believe the top six vendors will continue to dominate the market with over 85 per cent share,"" said William Li, Research Analyst in Semiconductor and Components team.However, ODMs are still facing shortages of key components like power management IC, display driver IC (with display panel) and CPUs.
""We have found a 20 per cent-30 per cent gap between orders (end-demand) and actual shipments (supply), largely owing to the component shortage beginning H2 2020,"" Li noted.Some vendors also said the demand for audio codec IC and LAN chip remained unsatisfied and would continue to remain so in the second half of this year.
""Since we do not see any meaningful foundry capacity expansion in H2 2021, it is unlikely that the lead time for key IC components would recover from the current status,"" Li added.PC brands and ODMs cannot fully solve the shortage issue and clear the orders backlog and the report expects the demand-supply gap to gradually normalise in late H1 2022.In the second half this year, the momentum from the previous half will continue and reach a peak with back-to-school (some will be virtual classes) demand as well as the pent-up demand from H1 2021.Premium models with higher ASPs could take the lead via big promotions, which may squeeze out Chromebook's market share in H2 to some extent.

The central government has focused on the development of real economy and unswervingly building manufacturing power, having a new development pattern of ""dual circulation,"" the report said.
The main body of the real economy is manufacturing, which is the important support for a city's core competitiveness.Shanghai's manufacturing industry also faces challenges; for example, more investment is needed for innovative research and development, industrial chains still need to be improved, and the international competitiveness of leading enterprises still needs to be enhanced, according to the plan.

semiconductor,china,China big tech at a critical crossroad,"The earlier clampdowns have come from the angle of a moral hazard reduction in the China economy via new restrictions on the fintech units of China's big tech firms, due to imprudent micro consumer lending practices.

The latest clampdown and especially on the new potential restrictions banning China tech firms to list overseas, particularly in the US, seems to relate to national security concerns.
Hence, these latest restrictions imposed on China's tech giants seem to have evolved into a national security agenda, rather than a correction on business practices, which have integrated into the bigger sphere of the ongoing US-China tech war.

Photo: VCGEthnic minorities, the self-employed and low-income families in Britain suffered greater deprivation levels during the coronavirus pandemic despite ""surprisingly positive"" living standards figures, a report published Thursday found.The Institute for Fiscal Studies [IFS] think tank's annual report on living standards, poverty and inequality identified these groups as the hardest-hit, even as unprecedented state support mitigated the worst effects of the crisis.The research also shows that Britain's ethnic minorities were more likely to suffer worse health and economic outcomes during the pandemic and less likely to accept vaccines.
""How fast and to what extent these groups recover as the economy reopens will be a key determinant of the pandemic's legacy,"" said report's co-author Tom Wernham.Some 15 percent of Britons from minority ethnic backgrounds were behind their household bills at the start of 2021, compared with 12 percent before the pandemic.The proportion of adults of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin living in households where all adults were unemployed or furloughed remained 10 percentage points higher at the beginning of 2021 than pre-pandemic levels, as many of these households relied on one income earner.Household worklessness for black adults rose 2.4 percent, higher than the national average of 1.9, the report added.The share of self-employed workers who lost all work in the first lockdown in March 2020 and fell behind household bills is now 15 percent, up from 2 percent before the pandemic.Despite the government's flagship furlough scheme, which has paid millions of workers' wages since March 2020, 36 percent of self-employed workers were in fact ineligible from this scheme.Researchers also found that more families suffering from in-work poverty fell behind on bills during Britain's first lockdown from March 2020.One of the report's authors, Tom Waters, said the furlough scheme's success largely explained Britain's ""surprisingly positive"" deprivation and labor market statistics.But he added that people's ability to return to their old jobs or find new ones would be the key factor for living standards as support was withdrawn.The government initially paid 80 percent of employees' wages to prevent mass job losses but is to be phased out by the end of September.AFP",2021-08-31,Global Times,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1228178.shtml

semiconductor,china,"Preventing oxygen release leads to safer high-energy-density batteries : 
Research","New Delhi: A research group has produced fresh insights about the release of oxygen in lithium-ion batteries, which could pave the way for more robust and safer high-energy-density batteries.Next-generation batteries that store more energy are critical if societies are to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and realize carbon neutrality.
However, the higher the energy density, the higher the likelihood of thermal runaway -- the overheating of batteries that can sometimes result in a battery exploding.Oxygen released from cathode active material is a trigger for thermal runaway, yet knowledge of this process is insufficient.Researchers from Tohoku University and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) investigated the oxygen release behaviour and relating structural changes of cathode material for lithium-ion batteries LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111).
After the Ni reduction finished, Co3+ decreased, while Mn4+ remained invariant during 5 mol per cent of oxygen release.
""The reduction behaviours strongly suggest that high valent NI (Ni3+) enhances oxygen release significantly,"" said Takashi Nakamura, coauthor of the paper.To test this hypothesis, Nakamura and his colleagues prepared modified NCM111 containing more Ni3+ than the original NCM111.
To their surprise, they discovered the NCM111 exhibited much severer oxygen release than expected.Based on this, the research group proposed that the high valent transition metals destabilize lattice oxygen in oxide-based battery materials ""Our findings will contribute to the further development of high energy density and robust next-generation batteries composed of transition metal oxides,"" said Nakamura",2021-08-31,ET Auto,https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-components/preventing-oxygen-release-leads-to-safer-high-energy-density-batteries-research/84442680

There’s a need to have resilient supply chains and to have the right processes in place to manage that going forward.
But equally, they’re looking at how supply chain finance can be used to reduce the cost of funding across the supply chain, and therefore lower the cost of production, which ultimately makes that supply chain more competitive than others.

The independent experts said that vaccinations should not be the only condition to permit international travel, given limited global access and inequitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
The experts had previously said that requiring proof of vaccination deepens inequities and promotes unequal freedom of movement.

""On average, centenarians have an immune age that is 40 years younger than what is considered 'normal',"" Furman said of those participating the study.
""We have one outlier, a super-healthy 105 year-old man (who lives in Italy) who has the immune system of a 25 year old.""

More specifically, the company is calling performance per watt the replacement for Moore's Law as the driving goal for design.
According to Arm, performance per watt is ""a new paradigm"" that will take over, as more modern designs are considering computational efficiency as one of the primary factors for further improvement.
To get better designs, engineers must target a certain performance point, while using as little power as possible.
