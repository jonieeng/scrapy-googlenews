25-3-2019,"Samsung Electronics warned on Tuesday that it would report disappointing financial results thanks to slumping prices for chips and LCD screens, in another sign of slowing demand for smartphones and other gadgets.
The South Korean electronics giant said it was anticipating a “widening price fall among major products” for the first three months of the year amid “weakening overall demand” for its products.
The disclosure was unusual for Samsung, which typically offers a forecast of its financial performance shortly after the end of its quarterly period.
The announcement from one of the workhorses of the consumer electronics industry is the latest indication of waning global demand for sophisticated tech products.

25-3-2019,"But a deeper look reveals existence of an important “supply chain economy.”According to the researchers, “Supply chain industries are a distinct and large segment of the economy.
The new supply chain research suggests an expanded view that innovation and well-paying jobs can also come from the suppliers of services.
‘How is the supply chain working?’When Mills worked as Administrator of the US Small Business Administration in the Obama White House, she noticed a secret national treasure: A booming supply chain of parts and services made up of innovative, large and small businesses across the country.
They grouped industries into supply chain versus business-to-consumer (B2C), to find the percentage of outputs in each of these areas.
